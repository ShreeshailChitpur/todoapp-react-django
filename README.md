# Task Manager Application
This project is a Simple Task Manager application built using Django as the backend and React.js as the frontend. The backend is developed with the Django REST Framework, which provides API services, while the frontend is implemented using React to manage tasks interactively.

This application is essentially a to-do list that allows users to create, manage, and track tasks, categorized as Completed or Incomplete.

Features
Add Task: Allows the user to add a new task with a title and description.
Mark as Complete/Incomplete: Users can mark tasks as completed or incomplete using toggle functionality.
Task Filters: Users can filter between completed and incomplete tasks for better task management.
Tech Stack
Backend: Django, Django REST Framework
Frontend: React.js
Database: SQLite (default), can be configured to use other databases.
How It Works
Add Task: Users can click the "Add Task" button, which opens a form to input the task's title and description. Additionally, users can check or uncheck the task's completion status.
Manage Tasks: Tasks can be managed in two categories: Completed and Incomplete. Users can navigate between these tabs to track their tasks.
Real-time Updates: The app updates the task list dynamically without needing a full page reload.
